Printing,A4 ,UK Update,White Paper,Raheel,,,Amjad,,,Completed ,,"Recently, the UK Government introduced a White Paper titled Restoring Control Over the Immigration System, outlining a number of proposed reforms that could bring meaningful changes to how international students apply, study, and stay in the UK. These shifts are understandably drawing a lot of attention, not only from students but also from institutions and education consultants around the world.

As CEO of FES, I want to say that we welcome this renewed emphasis on quality, compliance, and long-term sustainability. These reforms, if implemented thoughtfully, will help preserve the credibility of the UK‚Äôs education system and ensure it remains accessible to students who are genuinely committed to academic and professional growth.

It‚Äôs natural to feel uncertain when big policy changes are introduced, but we believe these developments are a step in the right direction. A system built on transparency, fairness, and merit benefits everyone, students, universities, and the education sector as a whole.

We look forward to collaborating with the UK Home Office and Department for Education to support international student rights and promote sustainable growth in UK higher education recruitment.

Testimonial

Picture ‚Äì Saad Jadoon
My journey with FES started in 2016 when I met CEO FES, Tehsin Shah and he encouraged me to apply to Seneca College in Toronto, Canada. Before approaching FES, I felt overwhelmed by the complex admission and visa process for Canadian Colleges. From my very first visit, FES demonstrated true professionalism and commitment. Mr. Tehsin, along with Mr. Imran Khalil patiently answered every question, helped me craft a strong application and even provided career pathways and possible roles post grad.

That marked the start of a lasting relationship. Mr. Tehsin has kept in touch ever since, and I‚Äôve built a strong, respectful bond with him and the FES team.  FES guided me through a difficult time when I was an uncertain teenager, unsure about my future and direction. Today, I‚Äôve built a life in Canada, achieved several personal goals, and recently graduated from the University of Ottawa. I‚Äôm looking forward to what comes next, with FES still part of the journey.

I wholeheartedly recommend FES Higher Education Consultants to anyone who dreams of studying abroad. They turned what felt impossible and complex process into a structured, successful journey.
